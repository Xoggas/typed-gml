# 🎮 Typed GML

Typed GML is a **toolchain for GameMaker Studio** that brings modern language features to GML development.
It includes:

* 📝 A **custom transpiled language** with static typing and OOP features.
* ⚙️ A **transpiler** that compiles the new language into valid GML.
* 💻 A **VS Code extension** that integrates GameMaker Studio with the Typed GML compiler.

## ✨ Features (Planned)

* 🔒 **Static typing** – catch errors at compile time.
* 🏗️ **OOP support** – classes, inheritance, interfaces, etc.
* 🎯 **C#-inspired syntax** – familiar for developers coming from C#.
* 🖊️ **Editor integration** – autocompletion, error highlighting, and transpile-on-save in VS Code.

## 🚀 Goals

Typed GML aims to make GameMaker development more robust, scalable, and maintainable by offering a modern toolchain designed for new projects, without attempting to maintain compatibility with existing GMS projects.

## 📦 Components

* 🔤 **Typed GML Language** – custom syntax layer over GML.
* 🔄 **Transpiler** – converts Typed GML into native GML.
* 🧩 **VS Code Extension** – streamlines the workflow between GMS and Typed GML.
